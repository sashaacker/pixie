About
=====

The Pixie project started out of desire to build an irc bot in a way that did
not suck.  Rather than enumerate what I didn't like, I would rather go into
what I wanted, that I could not find.

* A bot that installs and runs
* A bot that has all the intrnals exposed for extension
* A bot that installs and runs and is extendable beyond simple channel commands
